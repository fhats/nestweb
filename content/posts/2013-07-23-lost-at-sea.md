This song is an epic tale of an old man forever sailing the seas waiting for
the wave that will finally wash him overboard to join his wife in the great
beyond. One of the first songs that Eric ever wrote, it has evolved through
many versions to become what it is today. As a group, we gave it a rock feel
while maintaining its folky elements.

With criss-crossing 3 part harmonies that define what we consider to be core to
our style, the song enjoys a unique thickness. In the 2nd verse, after the
lyrics "the waves roll o'er the deck," you'll hear Fred turn up the spring
reverb on his amp and give it a hefty kick to simulate a crashing wave.
