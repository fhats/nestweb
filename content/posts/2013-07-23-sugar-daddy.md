This tongue in cheek love letter to a young girl's sugar daddy is as much a
social commentary as it is light-hearted play. Written by Genny, this song
takes off with a driving funky bass line and syncopated mandolin adding a
uniquely reggae twist. Even the structure of the song is to be taken with a a
grain of salt, switching between minor and major keys. It doesn't have a
chorus, so the music is most engaging through the transitions. Listen to the
interweaving mandolin and guitar lead lines, the subtle harmonies, and the bass
solo at the end, and enjoy Genny's powerful vocal performance.
