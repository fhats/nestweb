The Nest is a five-piece folk rock band based in San Francisco with a chilled
out acoustic sound reminiscent of Crosby, Stills, & Nash, Okkervil River, and
Delta Spirit. With song styles ranging from quiet guitar ballads to
foot-stomping rock songs to something that might be reggae, their signature
three-part harmony adds an unmistakably old-school approach to modern folk
music.

Eric Shaw and Genny Krause provide lead vocals, banjo, mandolin, and rhythm
guitar. Fred Hatfull plays tasty and tasteful electric guitar leads, while Etan
Berkowitz holds down the low end on bass. Steve Johnson keeps time on the drums
and often adds his voice to the sonic landscape. Weather permitting, someone
may or may not also play a cello.
