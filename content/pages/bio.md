The Nest is a San Francisco folk rock band with a simple goal of making music
fun. This group of talented and diverse musicians have roots ranging from folk
and jazz to underground indie rock. With song styles ranging from quiet guitar
ballads to foot-stomping rock songs, their signature tight harmonies and
complex changes adds an unmistakably old-school approach to modern rock music.

Eric Shaw and Steve Johnson provide lead vocals, and harmonies though most of
the songs, one while playing playing a variety of stringed instruments, and the
other rocking the drumset. Fred Hatfull plays both tasty and tasteful electric
guitar leads, while Jerry Mark holds down the low end on bass.
