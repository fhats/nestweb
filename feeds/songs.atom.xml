the wave that will finally wash him overboard to join his wife in the great
beyond. One of the first songs that Eric ever wrote, it has evolved through
many versions to become what it is today. As a group, we gave it a rock feel
while maintaining its folky&amp;nbsp;elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With criss-crossing 3 part harmonies that define what we consider to be core to
our style, the song enjoys a unique thickness. In the 2nd verse, after the
lyrics &amp;#8220;the waves roll o&amp;#8217;er the deck,&amp;#8221; you&amp;#8217;ll hear Fred turn up the spring
reverb on his amp and give it a hefty kick to simulate a crashing&amp;nbsp;wave.&lt;/p&gt;

social commentary as it is light-hearted play. Written by Genny, this song
takes off with a driving funky bass line and syncopated mandolin adding a
uniquely reggae twist. Even the structure of the song is to be taken with a a
grain of salt, switching between minor and major keys. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have a
chorus, so the music is most engaging through the transitions. Listen to the
interweaving mandolin and guitar lead lines, the subtle harmonies, and the bass
solo at the end, and enjoy Genny&amp;#8217;s powerful vocal&amp;nbsp;performance.&lt;/p&gt;

The Nest plays this song hearkening back to country roots through the verses and choruses but adds hard-rocking instrumental breaks resulting in a more forward driving song with cross-genre flare. The sometimes dissonant harmonies and non-traditional vocal lines add that modern touch to a true&amp;nbsp;classic.&lt;/p&gt;
